# Fish_Tank_Monitor_and_Control v1.0.0 (2020-06-06)
> A set of tools to monitor and manage our fish tank
<br>
<i>
RaspberryPi / Arduino / Python / C++ project with scripts and tools designed to help automate and monitor our family fish tank. We have a 75 gallon hi-tech planted tank that utilizes co2 injection and automated EI dosing of plant fertilizers and other nutrients. With this set of tools we have  monitoring, graphing and alerting of all critical tank parameters, full electrical control of filters, uv light & pump, lighting, air pumps, co2 injection and our tank termperature controller.

This set of scripts is not really intended to be "plug-and-play" but rather a starting point for others to use in their tank projects. It is possible to use it "out of the box" if you are using all of the same components and your setup is the same.
