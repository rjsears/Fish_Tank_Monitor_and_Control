<i>This is a collection of scripts and tools designed to help automate and monitor our family fish tank. We have a 75 gallon hi-tech planted tank that utilizes co2 injection and automated EI dosing of plant fertilizers and other nutrients. With this set of tools we have  monitoring, graphing and alerting of all critical tank parameters, full electrical control of filters, uv light & pump, lighting, air pumps, co2 injection and our tank termperature controller.
